# LOCKIFY
LOCKIFY is a Web application offering an online data storage service. It's a student-led project, with no company or large development team behind it. The project is open-source, although sensitive data is (obviously) not shared.

You can open Issues if you encounter a problem, or if you wish to propose the addition of Functionalities or services (obviously, staying within the theme of the Online Storage Service).

I'm giving you access to all my documents, research and so on, so that you can understand how my project began, and how it progresses over time. You'll have access to all my knowledge about the project, so make good use of it!

## Important documents
In the important documents section, you will find the following documents:
- The Project Charter is a document used to quickly define all the terms of the project, what the project consists of, the Deliverables, etc.
- The Functional Specification is the first real document. This document largely consists of a precise and detailed explanation of the Project. This document will be updated regularly as the project evolves.
- The Technical Specification is the second most important document, explaining the technical details of the project. This document, too, will be modified as the project develops.
- Weekly Reports are weekly documents that retrace the activity carried out throughout the weeks. Each week has its own document, allowing you to see the progress of tasks, what's been done, or what's in progress during the week. They provide an overall view of the week and show the progress of the project as it unfolds.
- The last important document is the bug database, which shows what bugs are currently present in the project, what bugs have been encountered during the project, and how these bugs have been resolved. This document is also linked to the GitHub Issues, so you can have the GitHub Issues serve as a "form" for filling in the bug, and then explain in greater detail in a document the bug encountered, and how the bug was resolved.

## License and terms of use
I wrote a personalized license. This license does and does not allow you to do certain things.
I advise you to read it, it's not very long and it allows you to secure yourself in case of non-compliance with the rules. I don't want to deprive you of the use of LOCKIFY, but I do want to keep certain parts.
