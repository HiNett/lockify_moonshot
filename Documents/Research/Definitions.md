**Cloud Storage:** Cloud storage is a method of storing data online, in a third-party infrastructure. This method allows individuals and businesses to relocate their sensitive data, entrusting it to infrastructures that must maintain continuous access to the data, via a public or private connection, while ensuring data security.

**Object Storage:** Object storage is a data storage method that is increasingly used these days for its simplicity and speed. Object storage allows any file (a text file, for example) to be transformed into an object. This object will then contain our important data, as well as metadata and a unique identifier. Once stored, the file can be quickly retrieved with its metadata and unique identifier, making it much easier to find.

**Metadata:** Metadata is data that provides information about other data. For example, if I have a text file belonging to MR DUPONT, my metadata could be the file title, the file type, the file owner, the keywords, etc. Metadata can be stored in a database, or directly on the file itself by modifying the file properties.

**Data center:** There are several types of data centers, but the definition remains the same for all data centers. A data center is a physical space in which servers run continuously to store data, productive applications, perform machine learning, run artificial intelligence, and so on. Data center are essential these days, enabling us to store all our most valuable data and knowledge.

**Cloud Provider:** A Cloud Provider (also known as a Cloud Service Provider) is an IT company that offers computing power, data storage or runs applications that have access to the Internet. Cloud Providers fall into three broad categories: IaaS (infrastructure as a service), PaaS (platform as a service) and SaaS (software as a service).

**IaaS:** IaaS (infrastructure as a service) is a type of cloud computing that offers businesses a high-performance network, a server and virtualizations managed by the Cloud Provider. However, it is up to companies to put in their own software, executables and so on. So the service being sold is the infrastructure itself, not additional software to manage it or anything else.

**PaaS:** Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a type of Cloud Computing that enables businesses to develop, deploy, manage and run applications without any problems. It allows developers to work with all the tools they need, without having to worry about software or operating system updates. Everything is provided so that developers can create a worry-free application. PaaS offers a wide range of middleware (operating system, framework, SDK, etc.), as well as a graphical interface, command line, API or all three, depending on the provider.

**SaaS:** SaaS (Software as a Service) is the latest type of Cloud Computing. It offers businesses an all-in-one solution. SaaS provides a secure network, servers, infrastructure, storage, data, development, management and execution software, as well as the ability to run applications anywhere in the world. In fact, SaaS makes it possible to run servers continuously to host applications ranging from a simple website to Netflix, for example. This means that users all over the world with an Internet connection can connect to the service.

**Cloud Computing:** Cloud computing offers users computing resources, such as computing power, databases or storage, remotely via the Internet. Generally speaking, Cloud Computing is based on the principle of "You pay for what you use", which considerably reduces the costs for businesses and allows companies that are just starting up again to have remote offices until they can resume face-to-face activity.

**Virtualization:** Virtualization enables the components of a physical machine to be simulated on a virtual server. This means that a computer's hard disk, processor and RAM can be broken down into several pieces to create virtual machines (known by the abbreviation VM). So you have the power of a physical machine, which imitates the operation of that same machine, while offering it remotely.

**Cloud Scalability:** Cloud Scalability is the process of increasing or decreasing cloud computing resources. It allows users to have more or less storage space, computing power, internet connection, etc.

**API:**
