**Cloud Storage:** Cloud storage is a method of storing data online, in a third-party infrastructure. This method allows individuals and businesses to relocate their sensitive data, entrusting it to infrastructures that must maintain continuous access to the data, via a public or private connection, while ensuring data security.

**Object Storage:** Object storage is a data storage method that is increasingly used these days for its simplicity and speed. Object storage allows any file (a text file, for example) to be transformed into an object. This object will then contain our important data, as well as metadata and a unique identifier. Once stored, the file can be quickly retrieved with its metadata and unique identifier, making it much easier to find.

**Metadata:** Metadata is data that provides information about other data. For example, if I have a text file belonging to MR DUPONT, my metadata could be the file title, the file type, the file owner, the keywords, etc. Metadata can be stored in a database, or directly on the file itself by modifying the file properties.

**Data center:** There are several types of data centers, but the definition remains the same for all data centers. A data center is a physical space in which servers run continuously to store data, productive applications, perform machine learning, run artificial intelligence, and so on. Data center are essential these days, enabling us to store all our most valuable data and knowledge.

**Cloud Provider:** A Cloud Provider (also known as a Cloud Service Provider) is an IT company that offers computing power, data storage or runs applications that have access to the Internet. Cloud Providers fall into three broad categories: IaaS (infrastructure as a service), PaaS (platform as a service) and SaaS (software as a service).

**IaaS:** IaaS (infrastructure as a service) is a type of cloud computing that offers businesses a high-performance network, a server and virtualizations managed by the Cloud Provider. However, it is up to companies to put in their own software, executables and so on. So the service being sold is the infrastructure itself, not additional software to manage it or anything else.

**PaaS:** Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a type of Cloud Computing that enables businesses to develop, deploy, manage and run applications without any problems. It allows developers to work with all the tools they need, without having to worry about software or operating system updates. Everything is provided so that developers can create a worry-free application. PaaS offers a wide range of middleware (operating system, framework, SDK, etc.), as well as a graphical interface, command line, API or all three, depending on the provider.

**SaaS:** SaaS (Software as a Service) is the latest type of Cloud Computing. It offers businesses an all-in-one solution. SaaS provides a secure network, servers, infrastructure, storage, data, development, management and execution software, as well as the ability to run applications anywhere in the world. In fact, SaaS makes it possible to run servers continuously to host applications ranging from a simple website to Netflix, for example. This means that users all over the world with an Internet connection can connect to the service.

**Cloud Computing:** Cloud computing offers users computing resources, such as computing power, databases or storage, remotely via the Internet. Generally speaking, Cloud Computing is based on the principle of "You pay for what you use", which considerably reduces the costs for businesses and allows companies that are just starting up again to have remote offices until they can resume face-to-face activity.

**Virtualization:** Virtualization enables the components of a physical machine to be simulated on a virtual server. This means that a computer's hard disk, processor and RAM can be broken down into several pieces to create virtual machines (known by the abbreviation VM). So you have the power of a physical machine, which imitates the operation of that same machine, while offering it remotely.

**Cloud Scalability:** Cloud Scalability is the process of increasing or decreasing cloud computing resources. It allows users to have more or less storage space, computing power, internet connection, etc.

**API:** Set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. APIs enable different software applications to communicate with each other. 

**Encryption:** A method to secure data by converting it into a code, so that only those with the correct key or password can access the original data. It's crucial for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access

**Access Control:** Mechanisms that limit access to data or resources to authorized users, groups, or systems. This includes physical and digital measures to secure data against unauthorized access

**Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or other entity in a computer system, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in the system. This can involve passwords, biometric data, or other methods

**Authorization:** After authentication, authorization determines what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. This involves setting permissions and rights to access and perform actions on data or resources

**Data Integrity:** Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle. This is critical to prevent data from being altered or tampered with by unauthorized parties.

**Backup and Recovery:** Strategies and processes involved in copying data to a secure location so that it can be restored in case of data loss, corruption, or a disaster. This ensures the continuity of data accessibility.

**Disaster Recovery:** A plan and set of procedures to recover and protect a business IT infrastructure in the event of a disaster. This includes natural disasters, cyber attacks, and other threats to data and systems.

**Compliance:** The adherence to laws, regulations, and standards related to data security, privacy, and other aspects of IT. This includes industry-specific regulations such as HIPAA for healthcare or GDPR for data privacy in the EU.

**Incident Response:** The process of responding to and managing security incidents, including breaches, data leaks, and other threats to data and systems. This involves identifying, containing, and mitigating the impact of incidents.

**Vulnerability Management:** The process of identifying, prioritizing, and addressing vulnerabilities in IT systems and software. This includes patch management, security testing, and other measures to reduce the risk of exploitation.

**Penetration Testing:** The practice of testing a computer system, network, or web application to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. This is often done by simulating an attack to identify weaknesses and improve security measures.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** A system that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications. This allows for early detection of security threats and helps organizations respond to incidents.

**Identity and Access Management (IAM):** A framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the right people have the right access to the right resources at the right times. This includes user provisioning, access control, and authentication.

**Redundancy:** The duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe.

**Secure Protocols:** Communications protocols that encrypt and secure data transmission over networks. Examples include HTTPS, SFTP, and SSL/TLS, which protect data in transit against interception and tampering.

**Audit Trails:** Records that chronologically catalog events or procedures to provide an operational history. Audit trails are essential for investigating security incidents and ensuring accountability in data access and usage.
